# Google-like Search Engine

This project replicates essential features of Google's search engine using HTML and CSS. It offers a familiar user interface with functionalities such as regular search, image search, and advanced search.

## Features

- Regular Google Search: Users can input a query and click "Google Search" to be directed to the search results page.
- Google Image Search: Users can perform image searches by entering a query and clicking the search button.
- Google Advanced Search: Provides users with advanced search options, including "all these words," "this exact word or phrase," "any of these words," and "none of these words."
- "I'm Feeling Lucky" Button: Similar to Google's behavior, clicking this button takes users directly to the first search result, bypassing the results page.

## Implementation

- HTML: Structured the web pages with HTML elements, including forms, input fields, buttons, and links.
- CSS: Styled the pages to resemble Google's aesthetics, focusing on centered search bars, rounded corners, and consistent button styling.

## Development
